I created this repository to store / possibly enhance and develop the vertical stress contours drawing algorithm/code. 
(Main reason -> CE366 course has a bonus assignment)
Right now it is written in golang, I preferred it due to its cleanness  and efficiency.
I might also add a basic web page to draw the contours...
